Beyond Archetypes  
### Real-Time Psycho-Digital Mapping and the Limits of Predictive Human Models  

**"When we classify people, we obscure the systems that shape them."**  

This repository contains tools and theory to:  
1. **Diagnose why archetype-based models fail** (static labels in dynamic systems)  
2. **Map how information environments actually shape behavior** (without psychological reductionism)  
3. **Quantify choice narrowing in real-world systems** (finance, health, policy)  

▶ **For engineers, policymakers, and researchers building ethical predictive systems.**

## **Core Insight**  
Digital twins and behavioral models increasingly rely on **personality archetypes** (e.g., "Type A", "Risk-Averse"). This paper shows why these fail:  

| Archetype Approach | Psycho-Digital Mapping |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Classifies people  | Analyzes systems       |
| Assumes fixed traits | Maps dynamic constraints |
| Asks "Who are you?" | Asks "What are you seeing?" |
| Predicts behavior  | Reveals steering mechanisms |
